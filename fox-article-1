# Re-Imagining Normal: The Power of High Sensitivity and Nature’s Wisdom
 
As a younger highly sensitive person (HSP), I often found myself yearning for what I considered “normal.” A life with less emotions and over-stimulation, fewer tears, fewer disruptions from my relentless brain, and definitely fewer occasions where my senses seem to shout at me.
 
For most of my life, I attempted to mute my high sensitivity, alternating between bouts of over- and under-eating and numbing myself with alcohol. I tried to "fix" it, "heal" it, "overcome" it, and even "outsmart" it. All this did was lead me down a path of depression, anxiety, burnout, and a constant sense of not fitting in or being or doing “enough.”. The societal "norm" I was attempting to emulate was my boulder and I was Sisyphus.
 
This intense sensitivity to the world around me used to be downright frustrating and exhausting at times, and I know that it's something that many HSPs struggle with, too. Our senses are heightened, our emotions can overwhelm us, and the day-to-day life we navigate (especially in our modern world) can sometimes feel like an assault course designed for a different kind of person: the “normal,” the typical, the majority. But we are not those things. And I’m damn glad.
 
Eventually, I came to realize something that has changed the course of my highly sensitive experience forever. The struggles with sensitivity stem not from our inherent sensitivity, but from the shame and frustration we feel in response to this natural trait [1].
 
I was like a plant trying to grow in an environment that did not support my unique needs and then blaming myself for not thriving.
 
Yes, being part of a small fraction of the population can make us feel isolated and strange, but the real issue lies within. It's not the unique traits of being a highly sensitive person (HSP) that are the problem. Rather, it's the internalized resentment, frustration, and shame we cultivate towards ourselves.
 
Shame is often misunderstood. At its core, it's a mechanism intended to motivate us to protect our sense of safety, belonging, contentment, and joy. But when left unchecked, or when we're not taught how to nurture these emotions from within, we start to internalize instances of shame, which inevitably leads to a harmful self-identity.
 
Having a trait that differs from the mainstream, one that demands living outside the “norm,” can exacerbate this problem. It calls on us to advocate for our needs and boundaries, potentially exposing our unique sensitivity to others. And if we do not, we risk harming our physical, emotional, and mental health.
 
Feeling trapped in this dilemma, we resort to overcompensation through people-pleasing, self-loathing, and overworking — all roads leading to eventual burnout. As children, the adults in our lives were often unprepared to meet our needs, leaving us without tools to cope with our unique traits.
 
But there is a way forward. By developing a system to care for ourselves physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, we can unravel the shame entangled with our sensitivity. We can begin to appreciate the unique gifts and strengths it offers us and how they can be used for the betterment of our world.
 
When we internalize instances of shame as personal defects, the challenges of being an HSP are magnified. We begin to believe the false narrative that shame instructs us to remain unseen and unobtrusive. But in truth, shame is a signpost pointing us towards self-secured safety, belonging, contentment, and joy.
 
Shame encourages us to use our high sensitivity as a compass, guiding us towards meaningful change in our lives and the world. It asks us to view instances of discomfort or challenge not as threats, but as gateways to safety, belonging, contentment, and joy.
 
When embraced, shame can usher in a sense of wholeness and confidence. Trusting in our high sensitivity, allowing ourselves to be seen, and celebrating our uniqueness become possible.
 
Our current relationship with shame isn't serving us. It's time to see it for what it truly is — not a painful stigma, but an invitation to understand and embrace our high sensitivity. By doing so, we can begin to appreciate it as a gift, enabling us to bring healing to ourselves and the collective.

 
When we constantly compare ourselves to a perceived societal standard or "norm,” we find ourselves wanting and always feeling like the different, “weirdo.” This can lead to an internal mountain of shame, a painful feeling of being fundamentally flawed, wherein there’s no real attempts at understanding the true nature of our sensitivity. Without understanding, there’s no genuine, appropriate, and effective support offered to it. And so, the cycle of frustration, wanting, hiding, and resentment just continue.


Sensitivity is a natural occurrence, a beautiful blend of the air and ether elements, if we think in terms of the Ayurvedic philosophy. Like air, we are mobile, light, and expansive, able to capture the most minute details. Like ether, we are subtle, clear, and all-encompassing, providing space for deep processing of experiences. This understanding was liberating, it reframed my sensitivity from a burden to a bridge, a gateway into a more profound experience of the world that most others can only begin to imagine!
 
Our sensitivity grants us direct access to life's subtleties, providing a uniquely detailed perspective on the world. In a society driven by technology, immediacy, and incessant stimulation, it is the highly sensitive people who have the capacity to disrupt the status quo and challenge norms that are unsupportive or harmful.
 
But how do we harness our high sensitivity to enact this change? The answer lies in reconnecting with the rhythms of nature.

 
The greatest antidote to shame AND cultivating resilience, ease, and joy as a HSP is by aligning with nature’s rhythms. I began to see how the shame I carried was a consequence of living out of sync with my inherent nature and rhythms, rather than any defect on my part.

Drawing from nature's wisdom is key to understanding and navigating high sensitivity. Nature is inherently cyclical, embracing change, flow, and adaptation as a part of life. HSPs can look to nature to understand the validity of their emotional landscape and its changes. By living seasonally and aligning our daily routines with nature's rhythms, we can help balance our heightened sensory experiences and learn to live in harmony with our sensitivity.

Nature's wisdom is inherent in its cyclicity and adaptability. The rhythm of seasons, the ebb and flow of tides, the waxing and waning of the moon — these natural phenomena teach us to accept and adapt to change. They provide a blueprint for highly sensitive people to navigate our sensitivity and emotions.
 
Living seasonally and aligning our daily routines with nature's rhythms can create balance and harmony. For instance, attuning our waking and sleeping patterns with the sunrise and sunset can enhance our rest and productivity. Eating seasonal produce can ensure we're nourishing our bodies with what it needs at that time.
 
Shame, in this context, is a signpost, a messenger alerting us to areas of our lives that require change. It's not a mechanism for self-derision, but rather, a motivator to create a sense of safety, belonging, contentment, and joy. By changing our relationship with shame, we can reframe it as a guiding force towards change, not a hindrance.

 
Inspired by nature and its profound wisdom, I began to align my lifestyle with its rhythms. Just as the seasons of the earth dictate the cycles of life, our own bodies and minds have their rhythms, tied intricately to the world around us.

 
With our sensitivity, coupled with the lessons from nature, we can become agents of change in our lives and the world. Moments of discomfort or challenge are not threats, but gateways towards a life mirroring the inherent wisdom of nature. As we listen to these prompts, we can disrupt harmful norms and adopt healthier, nature-aligned ways of living.

 
One spring, as I observed the budding trees around me, I decided to mirror nature’s renewing energy. I implemented a new morning routine, waking up at dawn and spending the first hour of my day meditating and practicing yoga. This routine brought an unparalleled sense of peace and vitality to my days, akin to the freshness of spring.
 
But aligning with nature's rhythms isn't exclusive to spring. Each season has a rhythm, a unique energy you can incorporate into your daily routines. For instance, during winter, allow yourself more time for rest and reflection, just like hibernating animals.
 
Just as nature’s rhythms guide the turning of seasons and the growth of living things, so too can they guide us, highly sensitive individuals, towards healing and wholeness. By honoring these rhythms, we can navigate life with more grace, ease, and resilience.
 
When we embrace our sensitivity and live in alignment with nature's rhythms, we begin to see our unique abilities not as burdens, but as gifts. We start to realize our potential as healers, teachers, and changemakers – disruptors of the toxic status quo. We are the torchbearers of a gentler way of living, more attuned to the natural world and its inherent wisdom.
  
Our contemporary world, driven by technology, immediacy, and relentless stimulation, is naturally challenging for HSPs. Yet, we are innately equipped to disrupt this status quo. Our sensitivity, when understood and nurtured, allows us to access subtler aspects of life and recognize the unsupportive norms of modern culture. We are nature's outliers, the sensitive gauge that measures the balance between human living and natural rhythms.

As HSPs, we are uniquely equipped to sense the discord between modern cultural norms and more life-affirming, natural ways of being. Our sensitivity is a natural antidote to the toxic aspects of our culture that prioritize speed, productivity, and constant availability over health, well-being, and harmony with our environment.
 
Our inability to healthily function with the norms of our society is not a weakness, but a strength that urges us to disrupt the status quo.
 
When we harness our high sensitivity, we can become agents of meaningful change in our lives and the world. We can view instances of discomfort or challenge not as threats but as gateways towards a life that mirrors the inherent wisdom of nature — a life that holds space for safety, belonging, contentment, and joy.
 
In embracing shame and understanding high sensitivity, we can realize our capacity as catalysts for change. The challenges we face are not mere obstacles, but they are prompts pushing us to disrupt harmful norms and adopt a healthier, nature-aligned way of living.
 
If highly sensitive people can overcome shame, comprehend the true nature of high sensitivity, and align themselves with nature, they have the potential to change the world. Our sensitivity is not a curse; it's a unique tool that helps us forge deeper connections with ourselves, others, and the planet.
 
By reframing our relationship with shame and high sensitivity, we can usher in an era of wholeness, confidence, and celebration of our uniqueness. We are not a deviation from the norm; we are the harbingers of a new norm — one that recognizes the inherent wisdom in sensitivity and the transformative power it holds for our world.

 
In essence, being "normal" is overrated. Being different, being sensitive, being attuned to the subtle energies and rhythms of life – these are strengths. And in a world that sorely needs healing, these strengths are nothing short of superpowers.
 
As HSPs, our mission is not to fit into a world that is not designed for us, but to reshape that world. To usher in a new normal that is kinder, gentler, and more in tune with nature. And in doing so, we create a world that is not only more comfortable for us, but a healthier and more sustainable world for everyone.
 
So, as a fellow HSP, I ask you: What small steps can you take to align your daily routine with nature’s rhythms? How can you honor your sensitivity rather than fight it? Let's start a conversation about our collective journey as highly sensitive people, stepping into our power and creating meaningful change in our world.
